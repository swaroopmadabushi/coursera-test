                        In the UK and Ireland adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks, whereas in America, Australia and Canada 
                        they are more commonly called roosters. Males less than a year old are cockerels.[7] Castrated roosters are called capons (surgical and 
                        chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year old are known as hens and younger females as pullets[8] 
                        although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs at 16 to 20 weeks of age. In Australia and 
                        New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term chook /ˈtʃʊk/ to describe all ages and both sexes.[9] The young are called 
                        chicks and the meat is called chicken. "Chicken" originally referred to young domestic fowl.[10] The species as a whole was then called 
                        domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of "chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens", sometimes used as a British public house or 
                        theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands). The word 
                        "chicken" is sometimes erroneously construed to mean females exclusively, despite the term "hen" for females being in wide circulation. In the 
                        Deep South of the United States chickens are also referred to by the slang term yardbird.

                        Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times.[1] Beef 
                        is an excellent source of high-quality protein and essential nutrients.[2] Beef skeletal muscle meat can be cut into roasts, short ribs or 
                        steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.). Some cuts are processed (corned beef or beef 
                        jerky), and trimmings, usually mixed with meat from older, leaner cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some 
                        varieties of blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the 
                        reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where 
                        there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as 
                        calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as-is, but are more often cleaned and used as 
                        natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Beef from steers and heifers is very similar. According to the most recent 
                        National Beef Quality Audit[when?], heifer carcasses had slightly more marbling than steer carcasses, but USDA quality grade was not 
                        significantly different.[3] Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls is usually 
                        tougher, so it is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free 
                        on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding 
                        operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.

                        Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known today as nare-zushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly 
                        months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling;[1] the rice would be discarded before consumption of 
                        the fish.[2] This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi comes from an antiquated 
                        grammatical form no longer used in other contexts, and literally means "sour-tasting"; the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.[3]
                        Narezushi is still made in Japan to this day. Contemporary sushi generally bears only a vague resemblance to its predecessor. Funazushi, a 
                        strongly-flavoured and odoured narezushi made near Lake Biwa in Japan, most strongly resembles the traditional fermented dish among modern 
                        sushi types. Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste 
                        and preservation. In addition to increasing the rice's sourness, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the 
                        fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be furthered developed in Osaka, where over several 
                        centuries it became oshi-zushi; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds. This 
                        practice reached Edo (contemporary Tokyo) by the 18th century.[4] It was in Edo that contemporary sushi was created by Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858) 
                        at the end of period. Hanaya's version was a precursor to fast food; by avoiding all fermentation, the dish could be prepared therefore very 
                        quickly, and each roll was shaped for conveniently eating with one's hands. Portion sizes shrank to roughly a third of the previous norm to 
                        further accommodate this principle.[4] The dish was originally termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or 
                        Tokyo Bay); the term Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.[5][6] The 
                        Oxford English Dictionary notes the earliest written mention of sushi in English in an 1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi 
                        as "a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring".[7][8] However, there is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn's 
                        Japanese-English dictionary from 1873,[9] and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal Notes and Queries.[10]
